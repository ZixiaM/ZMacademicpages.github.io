I'm a graduate student from [the Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.engineering.buffalo.edu/ee.html/), [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.

I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Shaofeng Zou](https://www.XXX.com/) from [the Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.engineering.buffalo.edu/ee.html/), University at Buffalo, and [Prof. Jiyeon Kang](http://www.awearlab.com/) of AWEAR Lab from [the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/mechanical-aerospace.html), University at Buffalo. Before that, I was advised by [Prof. Wei Zhi](https://web.njit.edu/~zhiwei/) from [Ying Wu College of Computing](https://computing.njit.edu/), [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/).

You can find my CV here: [Zixia Meng's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
